### Link Submission Guide

**1.** Before submitting a link, please **[search](https://redd.it/105xraz)** to make sure it's not already in the wiki.

**2.** The order of priority is: **Site > GitHub > Store Link**
Please only use the store link if there's neither a site nor a GitHub available for the app/extension you'd like to submit.

**3.** Always check to see if the site you'd like to submit has a Discord / Telegram server you can link with it.

**4.** Find a suitable category for the link and then submit it by making a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pulls)**.

!!!info If you don't know how to make a Pull Request, you can follow **[this guide](https://rentry.org/fmhyedit)**.

!!!warning If you haven't tested the link you'd like to submit, especially if it's a DDL site, please open an **[Issue](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/issues)** or reach out to us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/5W9QJKuPkD)** rather than making a Pull Request.
